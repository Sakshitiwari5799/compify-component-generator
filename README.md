This is an AI-Powered Component Generator web application designed to help developers build beautiful, modern, and responsive UI components with ease.
The app leverages Google’s Gemini API to intelligently generate frontend components based on user-provided descriptions.

Users can describe the type of UI component they need (such as buttons, cards, forms, navbars, layouts, etc.), select a preferred framework or styling approach, and instantly receive production-ready HTML/CSS code along with a live preview.

The goal of this project is to speed up frontend development, reduce repetitive UI work, and provide developers with a smart assistant for generating clean, reusable components. The application features a modern interface, real-time code preview, copy/download functionality, and a smooth developer experience.

This project was built as a practical implementation of AI + Frontend Development, focusing on usability, performance, and clean UI design.
